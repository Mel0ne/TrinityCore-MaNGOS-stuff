## Repository with some legacy WoW emu stuff üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Here I collect the most interesting (for me in the past) stuff for different WoW emulators (MaNGOS and Trinity Core, basically), all over the Internet for the distant 2010-2014 years, when I was "cooked" in all this.

I think it's interesting to look at the developments of the wow-emu community of those years, and archive them.

Perhaps some of this can be revived and given a second life.

Over time, I will post more interesting stuff. Luckily, there's a lot more stored on my NAS hard drives üòÅ

## Authorship and credits ‚öñÔ∏è

I am not the author of the code posted in this repository, and I do not claim authorship.

Unfortunately, I have no way to find and list the names of all the developers. If you have discovered your old development and want to include your name in the readme, please contact me.

All credits and authorship goes to their developers.
