Using our DBC to MySQL Convertor

Note:
This program is only meant to work when run from Windows XP and above.
It might function under Wine, but we make no guarantees about this.

From Binaries:
1. Unzip the contents of "DBC to MySQL Binary.zip".  It can go pretty much anywhere.
   The directory containing the .zip file will work nicely.

From Source: (only compiling for Windows is currently supported)
1. Open DBCtoMySQL.rbvcp with RealBasic. (requires at least 2009r3)
2. Build Application.
3. Copy config.txt into \Builds - DBCtoMySQL.rbvcp\Windows\DBC to MySQL\
4. Do Steps 3 through 9 below.


2. Configure config.txt to match your CoreManager DBC database.
3. Launch "DBC to MySQL.exe"
4. Select the Localization Language of the DBC files.
5. Click "Select Directory"
6. Navigate to the directory containing your DBC files.
7. Click "Select"
8. Click "Start"
9. Wait.  This'll take a while.
