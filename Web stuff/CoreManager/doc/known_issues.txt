Here's a list of the things we're aware are wrong with CoreManager
================================================================================
(This doesn't mean that we've given up on them, rather that we haven't gotten to
them yet)
================================================================================

Not all searches on the Character List Page work.  (this is due to the nature of
the data)

Trinity Core support is only for the "Stable" release.  Other revisions may not
function.

The Character Sheet Page on Trinity Servers will display "ERR" for some stats.
(see below for list)

MaNGOS support is limited to MaNGOS 2.  Other versions may not work.


THINGS COREMANAGER CAN DO THAT SERVERS DON'T SUPPORT:
(we'd REALLY like to be able to have these things)
================================================================================
Online Player List on Main Page can show the Zone, Map AND Area of players.
MaNGOS and Trinity do not save Area.

The Character Sheet is meant to display the following stats: Melee Hit,
Expertise, Spell Heal, Spell Hit, Spell Haste, and Ranged Hit.  MaNGOS & Trinity
do not save these.

MaNGOS doesn't store Player Latency so Average Latency & Player Latency are
unavailable.
