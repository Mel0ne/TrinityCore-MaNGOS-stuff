		<faq question="What is the custom calendar tool?">
			The custom calendar tool allows you to export in-game player calendar data to online calendars such as Google Calendar or applications such as Microsoft Outlook.

		<faq question="How do I create a customized calendar feed?">
			Use the Armory's main menu or click the link on the top right of a character's calendar page to access the Calendar Feed Customization tool. The options on this page allow you to create a custom calendar feed that you can export to any compatible online calendar application.
			<p/>
			You can choose up to five characters on your account to aggregate into a single calendar feed. Simply select the characters you wish to appear in the feed from the drop-down menus. Event categories can be individually toggled to filter them in or out of the feed.

		<faq question="How do I use the custom feed once I create it?">

Refer to each website or application for full details (instructions for Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook 2007 are covered in the next two questions).

		</faq>
		<faq question="What is the 'reset security key' option used for?">
			Each calendar feed URL contains a unique security key appended to the end of the URL. This key is intended to keep your calendar data inaccessible to others. If you wish, you can reset your security key at any time by clicking the 'reset security key' button at the bottom of the page. If you reset your key, you must update the URL in your web-based calendars.
		</faq>
		<faq question="Why are my characters not appearing in the feed's character selection menu?">
			Only characters on Europe realms can be represented on feeds you create here, as this is the European version of the Armory. You can switch to a different region, such as USA, from the region selection menu at the bottom of the page. In addition, a character must be recently active, on an account in good standing, and be at least level 10 to appear on a calendar feed.
